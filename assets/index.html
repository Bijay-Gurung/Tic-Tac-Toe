                Let’s talk about Tic-Tac-Toe, or as some people call it, Noughts and Crosses or Twiddles and Bears. For many decades, this quick and easy game has been a firm favorite in most households.
Before it became a household game, there was quite a lot of mystery and intrigue surrounding the game. Some believed that it was a pagan ritual, and certain secret societies believed that it had hidden answers about the world embedded in its grid.
That aside, people have started to realize that Tic-Tac-Toe is just a game; a rather enjoyable one at that. If all of this has been news to you, perhaps it’s time to learn a little more about one of the world’s most-played paper and pencil games.
